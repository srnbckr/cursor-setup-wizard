<h1 align="center">Cursor Setup Wizard</h1>

<p align="center"><strong>A streamlined script to set up Cursor on Ubuntu-based systems with ease 🚀</strong></p>

<p align="center">
  Cursor Setup Wizard is a Bash script designed to simplify the installation, configuration, and even updates to the latest versions of Cursor — <em>sometimes beyond what's available on the official site (<a href="https://gist.github.com/jorcelinojunior/131748e12a039c02148a6f66e1fb312c?permalink_comment_id=5306523#gistcomment-5306523" target="_blank">see feedback</a>)</em>.<br/>
  Built specifically for Ubuntu-based systems, it addresses long-standing issues not resolved by Cursor itself, automates complex setup steps, and ensures a seamless experience for Linux users.

<details id="why-cursor-setup-wizard">
   <summary><h2>❓Why Cursor Setup Wizard?</h2></summary><br/>
   <p>
      This script was born from the frustration many Linux users faced, including myself, with the tedious and error-prone process of setting up <a href="https://www.cursor.com" target="_blank">Cursor</a>. These issues, highlighted in <a href="https://github.com/getcursor/cursor/issues/1465" target="_blank">issue #1465 from the official Cursor repository</a>, made it clear that an automated solution was needed.<br/><br/>
      I initially shared a workaround in a <a href="https://gist.github.com/jorcelinojunior/131748e12a039c02148a6f66e1fb312c" target="_blank">gist</a>, and the thoughtful feedback and suggestions in the comments inspired me to refine it into the tool you see here. The collaborative input from the community, including suggestions, feature requests, and shared solutions, was instrumental in shaping this project.<br/><br/>
      Cursor Setup Wizard ensures you can focus on what truly matters: coding, without the hassle of manual steps.<br/><br/>
      <small><em>🌟 I hope this repository proves helpful to others as well. It's an evolution of one of my first contributions, and I look forward to creating even more tools to assist the community. Feedback and improvements are always welcome! 💜</em></small>

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Supported OS**: Ubuntu-based Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, Pop!_OS, Linux Mint, etc).
- **Permissions**: `sudo` privileges for dependency installation and system configuration.
- **Internet Connection**: Required to download Cursor, its components and dependencies.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

To get started immediately, run:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srnbckr/cursor-setup-wizard/main/install.sh)
```

This command downloads the main script (`cursor_setup.sh`), places it in `${HOME:-~}/cursor-setup-wizard/`, makes it executable, and runs it. It's the fastest way to set up Cursor without hassle.

---

## ⭐ Features

- **All-In-One Installation**: Automatically fetch, download, and configure Cursor.
- **AppArmor Integration**: Applies a basic security profile for added safety.
- **Launcher Creation**: Generates launchers for both desktop and application menus to provide quick access.
- **CLI Command**: Adds a `cursor` command for launching Cursor from the terminal.
- **Interactive UI**: Provides an enhanced terminal experience using [`gum`](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum).
- **Script Editing**: Built-in menu option for editing the script with your preferred editor.

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

When you run the script, you’ll see an interactive menu like this:

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorcelinojunior/cursor-setup-wizard/main/images/menu.png" alt="Cursor Setup Wizard Menu" width="600"/></p>

- **All-in-One**: Fully automates the download, setup, and configuration process.
- **Reconfigure All**: Reuses the existing AppImage for reconfigurations without re-downloading.
- **Setup AppArmor Profile**: Configures or reapplies AppArmor for enhanced security.
- **Add 'cursor' CLI Command**: Adds or updates the `cursor` terminal command.
- **Edit This Script**: Opens the script in your preferred editor for customization.
- **Exit**: Closes the wizard.

At each step, the script provides clear prompts, spinners, and detailed logs to keep you informed.

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Fixes

#### **`Failed to fetch headers from the server`**
This error occurs when the script cannot retrieve necessary headers from the server. Possible solutions include:
- Ensure your internet connection is stable.
- Check if the `VERSION_CHECK_TIMEOUT` value (default **`5` sec**) is sufficient for your connection speed. Increase it if necessary.
- Verify that the `DOWNLOAD_URL` is correct. If you’ve modified it, ensure it points to a valid resource. The default is: [`https://downloader.cursor.sh/linux/appImage/x64`](https://downloader.cursor.sh/linux/appImage/x64).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorcelinojunior/cursor-setup-wizard/main/images/online-fetch-failure.png" alt="✖ Failed to fetch headers from the server" width="850"/>

---

#### **`No local version found`**
If you encounter this error, it means the AppImage could not be located. Use **`All-in-One`** to fetch it again.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorcelinojunior/cursor-setup-wizard/main/images/no-local-version-found.png" alt="✖ No local version found in..." width="500"/>

---

#### **`The password was incorrect`**
If you see this message, re-enter your password to proceed.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorcelinojunior/cursor-setup-wizard/main/images/the-password-was-incorrect.png" alt="✖ Oops! The password was incorrect. Try again." width="500"/>

---

#### **`Cursor Fails to Start`**
Check if AppArmor is active. Reapply its profile via the menu if needed (option **`Setup AppArmor Profile`**).

---

#### **`Launcher Issues`**
If the `.desktop` file is marked as untrusted, ensure `gio` is installed and D-Bus is running.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorcelinojunior/cursor-setup-wizard/main/images/untrusted-desktop-file.png" alt="Untrusted .desktop file" width="250"/>

---

#### **`Dependency Errors`**
Most of the required dependencies are already included by default in Ubuntu-based systems. The script performs a quick check to ensure everything is ready and installs any missing packages automatically. An active internet connection is needed for this process.

---

#### **`Gum Version Compatibility`**
The script requires **`gum`** version **0.14.5**. Avoid running `sudo apt update` while the script is open, as it may upgrade **`gum`** to version **0.15.0**, which can cause unexpected behavior. Restart the script if you update your system.
